# Granular — dual granular looper / sampler

`ENGINE=granular` (default) · `src/engine/granular/` (~50 files: adapter `granular_engine.{h,cpp}` + DSP) · class `GranularEngine`

The original instrument and the default build: a two-deck granular looper/sampler with recording, overdub, feedback, a per-deck step sequencer, FX, and CV/MIDI. This is the largest engine, and the one the platform's whole knob/pad grammar was designed around.

> Implementation, the DSP graph, and the file map live in [`docs/dev/granular-impl.md`](../dev/granular-impl.md). > Everything this page does **not** cover — power, clock and sync, CV/gate, routing, the SD card, > `config.txt`, MIDI and flashing — is shared by every engine and lives in [`../manual.md`](../manual.md).

**This page is the exhaustive control reference for granular.** It used to live in `docs/manual.md`, which is titled as the Spotykach manual and read as though granular were *the* instrument — awkward for a project of 21 interchangeable engines, and doubly so because granular is the one engine releases do not ship (it is the stock upstream firmware). The platform half of that document stayed put; the granular half is below.

## Decks and modes

Each deck records into its own loop buffer (up to 42 seconds) and plays it back through a granular engine in one of three modes, indicated by color:

- **Reel (yellow)** - tape emulation, monophonic. Speed and pitch are linked: faster playback raises pitch.

- **Slice (blue)** - digital sampler/looper with independent pitch and speed. Up to 3-voice polyphony; switch to mono with Alt+Size.

- **Drift (purple)** - granular texture generator; builds evolving soundscapes from a short recording.

## Recording and playback

- **Arm**: Alt+Play. Recording starts when the input crosses about -40 dB.

- **Stop and loop**: tap Play; the recorded material begins looping.

- **Overdub**: Alt+Play on a deck that is already playing. Overdub decay is set with Alt+Mix (feedback).

- **Cross-deck record**: Alt+Reverse records one deck into the other.

- **Reverse**: the Reverse pad plays the loop backwards.

## Primary controls (knobs)

| Knob       | Reel                    | Slice                          | Drift                  |
|------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|
| Pitch      | playback speed          | pitch (independent of speed)   | grain pitch modulation |
| Position   | loop start point        | loop start, quantized to 1/8   | grain position         |
| Size       | loop length (exp.)      | loop length (stepped)          | grain spread           |
| Envelope   | loop envelope: off, fade-out, fade-in/out, fade-in (cycles) | as Reel | as Reel |
| Mix        | input vs playback balance; Alt+Mix sets overdub feedback | same | same |

Alt+Pitch enables quantized pitch values. Alt+Size sets grain size in Drift and toggles mono/poly in Slice.

## Effects

Two families, each on a dedicated pad per deck. Hold the effect pad and tap the Tap button to cycle the effect type within the family; shape parameters live on the main knobs while the effect is held.

- **Grit**: signal degradation.

  - Analog saturation - soft saturation through to distortion (driven by Pitch).

  - Bit crusher / decimator - downsampling and bit reduction to harsh digital clipping.

- **Flux**: tape delay - Pitch sets tape speed (delay time), Mix sets wet level, Position sets feedback while Flux is active.

Each effect can be locked on (Alt + effect pad) so it stays engaged without holding.

## Modulation sources A and B

Each deck has a modulation source that is either an LFO or an envelope follower, with its own CV output (0 to +5 V).

- Source A: sample-and-hold or square LFO.

- Source B: sine or sawtooth LFO.

- The Cycle knob sets LFO rate, with tempo-sync divisions from 1/32 up to 4 bars.

- The Glow knob attenuates the modulation depth.

- The envelope follower tracks its deck's post-Mix output.

## Sequencer

Each deck has a 1/16-resolution trigger sequencer. Patterns persist across mode changes.

- **Record**: Alt+Seq to arm (Alt LED blinks white), then tap the deck's Seq pad in rhythm. Tap Alt or Play to stop.

- **Clear**: hold Alt+Seq for about 2 seconds (the Play LED blinks quickly).

## Under the hood

The rest of this page is orientation for the implementation.

### Modes (the routing/sequencer behaviour above, in code)

- **Slice** — playback and recording are synced to the clock.

- **Reel / Drift** — playback and recording are unsynced (free).

- When the **sequencer** is engaged, the clock drives playback in all modes.

These per-mode decisions live inside `Deck`; the engine forwards every transport tick to every deck and the deck's mode logic decides whether to act (see the transport-decoupling note below).

## Transport

Granular `Core` subscribes to the platform transport (`ITransport::set_on_tick`) and fans each tick out to the decks / panner / modulators / metronome click (the `Core::_on_transport_tick` sink — the granular half of the old `Driver`, which was split into the platform `Transport` + this sink). It also reads `is_key_sub_quarter()` for sequencer arming. Tempo, tap, clock-source, key-interval, and clock-out are platform-owned (see [README](README.md#the-transport-shared-clock)).

## Controls

Granular is the engine the platform's knob/modifier grammar was designed around, so it uses the full surface (the modifier columns in the [README routing table](README.md#knobs-how-a-physical-control-reaches-an-engine)): the direct knobs (Size/Pos/Speed/Mix/Env), the Flux/Grit FX-pad layers, the Alt layer (Feedback, PolySlice, mod sync), and the tap-hold layer (Tempo, KeyInterval, ClickMix, Pan). Pads drive record / play / reverse / sequencer-arm / FX, and MIDI notes trigger pitched grains. The mode/route switches go through `set_config`.

For the exhaustive control reference, the device's user manual is the authority (see the project `spotykach-manual` notes); `docs/architecture.md` covers the platform/engine layer.

## Persistence

`Storage` saves/loads loop audio and `config.txt` on the SD card via the engine's byte-range audio port (`audio_data` / `audio_recorded_bytes` / ...); `Settings` persists smaller settings. Granular advertises the tape-storage capability.

## Notes vs the published manual

The published manual's "Known Limitations" list is partly out of date relative to this firmware:

- **Gate outputs**: implemented here (short pulse on granular re-trigger); the published manual lists them as not implemented.

- **Buffer clearing**: a buffer clear exists internally and runs when re-arming a deck, but there is no dedicated user-facing "clear without recording" gesture yet.

- **Sample persistence between power cycles**: an auto-preload path exists; confirm the exact behaviour on your unit.

- **Spot pad**: currently used only for calibration entry; broader functionality is not yet implemented.

When you change any of the above (or any feature) in code, update this section and the relevant body text so the manual stays in sync.
