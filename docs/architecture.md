# Spotykach Architecture

This document describes the big-picture architecture of the Spotykach firmware: the
hardware platform, the platform/engine decoupling, the execution model, how the subsystems
fit together, and how audio and control data flow through the system. For a file-by-file map
of the source tree see [source-guide.md](source-guide.md). For the status and roadmap of the
platform/engine refactor see [refactor-status.md](refactor-status.md) and
[item3-plan.md](item3-plan.md). For an analysis of weaknesses and improvement opportunities
see [review-260529.md](review-260529.md).

## 1. What the instrument is

Spotykach is a screenless, dual-deck looping/sampling instrument. Each of the two decks
(A and B) records audio into its own loop buffer and plays it back through a granular
engine that can operate in three modes:

- **Reel** - tape emulation; playback speed and pitch are linked (monophonic).
- **Slice** - digital sampler/looper with independent pitch and speed; up to 3-voice
  polyphony.
- **Drift** - granular texture generator that spreads many overlapping grains from a
  short recording.

On top of the two decks sit shared facilities: a clock/transport with internal, TRS
(4 PPQN) and MIDI (24 PPQN) sync; per-deck modulation sources (LFO or envelope
follower) with CV outputs; two FX families per deck (Grit = saturation/bitcrush, Flux =
tape delay); an A/B crossfade; routing/panning (mono, stereo, generative stereo); a
per-deck step sequencer; and SD-card sample storage organised as 6 "tapes" of 6 slots.

This granular looper is the **reference engine** for the platform/engine design (section 3):
all of the above except the granular DSP itself is platform behaviour reusable by other engines.

The feature set documented in the user manual is summarised in
[review-260529.md](review-260529.md#appendix-manual-feature-map), where it is also
cross-checked against the code.

## 2. Hardware platform

The firmware targets an Electro-Smith **Daisy Seed** (STM32H7, Cortex-M7) and is built
against a pinned `bleeptools` fork of libDaisy plus DaisySP. Audio runs at **48 kHz**
with a **96-sample** block. The application is linked to run from SRAM and is started by
a custom Daisy bootloader (`APP_TYPE = BOOT_SRAM`, linker script `alt_sram.lds`,
`bootloader-spotykach-v2.bin`), which is why firmware is flashed over USB DFU from the
rear USB-C port rather than the Seed's own port.

Board I/O, all owned and initialised by the `Hardware` class (`src/hw/hardware.h`):

## 3. Platform and engine: the decoupled design

The firmware is a fixed hardware/UI **platform** that hosts one swappable DSP **engine** per
firmware build. The intent: one board, one interaction language (multi-function knobs with
`MValue` pickup, ring feedback, pad gestures, transport, SD tape storage, CV/gate, MIDI), and
many possible instruments. A "firmware variant" is a different `IEngine` implementation behind
the same platform. The granular looper is the first/reference engine; the payoff is that
engine #2 is small because it inherits the whole platform.

**One engine per binary.** Bare-metal, single image, no RTOS, no heap on the audio path,
booting from SRAM with very little headroom (hundreds of bytes free). Two engines neither fit
nor make sense in one image, so engine choice is a **build-time** decision (section 4), not
runtime.

### Layer map

Dependencies point downward; nothing below depends on anything above it.

```
            app.cpp / main.cpp          boot + wiring + the 4 execution contexts (section 5)
                  |
      +-----------+------------------------------+
      |                                          |
  src/ui/  (CoreUI)  --- the PLATFORM ---     src/memory/ (Settings, Storage)
      |   pots/pads/CV/MIDI/LEDs, MValue pickup,     |   config.txt + SD sample tape
      |   gesture grammar, transport, value display  |
      |                                          |
      +------------------ IEngine ---------------+    <-- THE SEAM (src/engine/iengine.h)
                          |
                  src/engine/  (the contract + engines)
                  IEngine, GranularEngine, (PassthroughEngine sketch),
                  ParamId/Capabilities, DisplayModel, engine_leds
                          |
                  src/core/  (the granular DSP graph)   <-- engine-private, platform-independent
                  Core, Deck, Generator/Vox, Buffer, Fx, Driver, Track, Panner, Modulator
                          |
                  src/hw/  (HAL: Daisy peripherals, SDRAM pool, board I/O)
```

- **`src/ui/` (CoreUI) - the platform.** Owns the interaction grammar and talks to the engine
  *only* through `IEngine`. Reads hardware, runs `MValue` pickup / `Hold` timers / the
  `_touched` modifier bitset / gesture recognition, composites LED overlays, owns the
  storage/tape state machine. It does not know what the engine *is*.
- **`src/engine/` - the seam + engines.** `IEngine` is the contract; each engine implements it
  and owns its DSP graph privately.
- **`src/core/` - the granular engine's private DSP.** Now platform-independent (no libDaisy
  include; all hardware injected via `EngineContext`). It is *not* a shared layer - it belongs
  to `GranularEngine`. A different engine brings its own DSP, not `Core`.
- **`src/hw/`, `src/memory/` - HAL and persistence.** Platform-side.

### The `IEngine` seam

`src/engine/iengine.h` is the entire contract between platform and engine:

- **Audio lifecycle - pure virtual, required of every engine:** `init(EngineContext&)`,
  `prepare()`, `process(in, out, size)`. The audio path is `app -> IEngine -> engine -> DSP`.
- **Everything else - virtual with no-op default bodies (Strategy A).** An engine overrides
  only what it supports. The platform-driven surface includes `set_param`/`param`,
  `handle_midi_*`, `set_fx`/`on_*_pad`/`on_seq_*`, `cv_*`/`on_gate_*`, the `audio_*` storage
  port, the `transport_*` group, `process_cv`, the LED queries (`*_leds`/`render_ring`,
  transitional), and `render(DisplayModel&)`.
- **Capability opt-in.** `capabilities()` returns a bitset (`CapRecording`, `CapTapeStorage`,
  `CapStepSequencer`, `CapLaunchQuant`, `CapTransport`, `CapDualDeck`). The platform offers
  recording/tape/sequencer as a *toolkit*; a non-looper returns a smaller set and does not
  override those methods. Granular concepts are never mandatory platform behaviour.

Because the defaults are inert, adding a method to `IEngine` does not break existing engines,
and a minimal engine (the `PassthroughEngine` sketch, `capabilities() == CapTransport`) is a
few dozen lines.

**Parameters and the mode fanout.** `ParamId` (`src/engine/engine_params.h`) is the logical
parameter vocabulary the platform speaks. The platform decides *which* `ParamId` a physical
control drives; the engine owns what the param means, including mode-dependent dispatch (e.g.
granular `Size` -> window-spread in Drift, loop-size otherwise). The platform never sees the
engine's `Mode`.

### Hardware-free core via `EngineContext`

`src/core/engine_context.h` is how the DSP graph avoids any libDaisy dependency. At `init()`
the platform fills an `EngineContext` - `sample_rate`, `block_size`, an `ITimeSource` (clock
abstraction; `daisy::System` on hardware, a host clock off-target), and `EngineBuffers` (the
large SDRAM buffers, from `SDRAMBuffer::pool()` on hardware or `malloc` on the host) - and
passes it to `engine.init(ctx)`. The core pulls nothing from hardware directly. This is also
what lets the desktop host harness (`host/`) run the real engine over WAV via `IEngine`.

> **Seam impurity (known):** `EngineBuffers` is currently shaped for the granular engine
> (`source`/`detect`/`delay`/`slices`/`track` per deck). A second engine with different buffer
> needs would force this to generalise (e.g. an opaque arena the engine sub-allocates).
> Acceptable while there is one engine; tracked for the Phase-5 build/boundary work.

### LEDs: `DisplayModel`

`src/engine/display_model.h` is a hardware-agnostic panel description (two 32-px `LEDRing`
canvases + named indicators) the engine fills and the platform blits to the WS2812 chain. The
engine never touches `Hardware`.

> **Status (transitional):** the granular engine currently reports LED *state* through query
> methods (`*_leds`, `render_ring`, `mix`, `route`) and the platform interprets it (palette,
> blink, `MValue` value-display overlays, storage/tape compositing). Item 3(a)'s
> `render(DisplayModel&)` migration moves the steady-state fill into the engine while the
> platform keeps its transient-overlay compositing - about 90% of the LED code is irreducible
> platform interaction-grammar, so this is "engine fills the base layer, platform composites on
> top," not a clean blit.

### Known residual coupling (closes during the remaining refactor items)

- ~~**Switch-config writes + deck-state readbacks** reach `Core` via `engine.core()`~~ **RESOLVED
  by item 3(a) (2026-06-02): `engine.core()` is deleted; `CoreUI`'s ctor takes `IEngine&`.** The
  former Categories 2-3 are now the `set_config`/`tempo_to_fit`/`toggle_grit_mode` config channel
  and the `DeckLayout`/`size_sets_tempo` knob-layout queries; seeding reads the engine's pre-seeded
  `param()`. The platform no longer touches `Core`. See [item3-plan.md](item3-plan.md).
- **`Driver`/transport** lives inside `Core` and is forwarded through `transport_*`.
  Conceptually platform; relocation to a platform transport service is deferred and will likely
  be forced by a second engine's `CapTransport`.
- **Build boundaries:** the blanket `-Isrc/` lets any layer include any other; Phase 5 splits
  into static libs with separate include roots to enforce the layering above.

## 4. Slotting in an engine

**"Filename or `#ifdef`?"** Neither alone, and not scattered `#if`s. Selection is a single
**build-time** choice driven by one Make variable that does two things together:

1. **Build graph (filenames):** the variable selects *which engine source files compile and
   link*.
2. **Type binding (one localised `#if`):** the same variable emits one `-D` that a single
   header turns into a `using ActiveEngine = ...;` alias.

The platform is polymorphic over `IEngine` (virtual dispatch), but the *concrete type is fixed
at compile time*: the engine is a static value member of `AppImpl` - no heap, no runtime
factory. That is deliberate; a runtime `IEngine*` factory would buy nothing (one engine per
image) and cost a heap allocation the real-time design forbids. There are **no** per-feature
`#ifdef`s in the platform - `CoreUI`/`Storage`/`app` speak only `IEngine`.

### Today (item 3(a) complete; engine-select mechanism not yet built)

Engine choice is **hardcoded** in `app.cpp` (`GranularEngine _engine;`), but the coupling that
blocked a clean swap is gone: `CoreUI`/`Storage` hold only `IEngine` (the `GranularEngine&` ctor
and `engine.core()` were removed by item 3(a), 2026-06-02). To swap engines today you still edit
`app.cpp`'s member declaration, but nothing else in the platform names the concrete engine. The
remaining step to a one-line swap is the `ENGINE`-variable + `engine_select.h` mechanism below
(item 3(b)). The current `Makefile` compiles `$(wildcard src/engine/*.cpp)` and relies on
`--gc-sections` to strip the unselected engine from the binary.

### Target (after item 3(a) deletes `core()` and the `GranularEngine&` ctor)

Once `CoreUI`/`Storage` hold only `IEngine&`/`IEngine*`, the concrete engine type appears in
exactly one place - `app.cpp`'s member declaration - and selection becomes a one-line build
flag.

`Makefile`:
```make
ENGINE ?= granular
ifeq ($(ENGINE), granular)
  C_DEFS += -DSPK_ENGINE_GRANULAR
  ENGINE_SOURCES = src/engine/granular_engine.cpp $(wildcard src/engine/granular/*.cpp)
else ifeq ($(ENGINE), passthrough)
  C_DEFS += -DSPK_ENGINE_PASSTHROUGH
  ENGINE_SOURCES = src/engine/passthrough_engine.cpp
endif
# replaces the current `$(wildcard src/engine/*.cpp)` so only the selected engine compiles
CPP_SOURCES += $(ENGINE_SOURCES) $(wildcard src/engine/shared/*.cpp)
```

`src/engine/engine_select.h` (new, the single `#if`):
```cpp
#pragma once
#if defined(SPK_ENGINE_GRANULAR)
  #include "engine/granular_engine.h"
  namespace spotykach { using ActiveEngine = GranularEngine; }
#elif defined(SPK_ENGINE_PASSTHROUGH)
  #include "engine/passthrough_engine.h"
  namespace spotykach { using ActiveEngine = PassthroughEngine; }
#else
  #error "No engine selected: set ENGINE=<name> in the Makefile"
#endif
```

`app.cpp`:
```cpp
#include "engine/engine_select.h"   // not granular_engine.h
...
ActiveEngine _engine;               // the only place the concrete type is named
```

Build a variant with `make ENGINE=passthrough`; the default stays `granular`.

### Writing a new engine - checklist

1. Subclass `IEngine`; implement the three pure-virtual lifecycle methods. Own your DSP
   privately (do not reuse `src/core/` - that is granular-specific).
2. Return a `capabilities()` bitset for the regions you support; override only those methods.
3. Map `ParamId`s in `set_param`/`param` (own any mode fanout internally).
4. If `CapTapeStorage`: implement the `audio_*` byte-port so the platform tape can save/load
   your buffer. If `CapTransport`: implement `transport_*` (or consume the platform transport
   service once `Driver` relocates).
5. Fill `render(DisplayModel&)` for your panel; the platform blits and composites overlays.
6. Add the engine to `engine_select.h` and the `Makefile` `ENGINE` switch.
7. Verify on hardware (no host harness covers the pot/pad/LED/MIDI paths) and watch `SRAM_EXEC`.

## 5. Execution model

There is no RTOS. Concurrency comes from interrupts layered over a single main loop.
`AppImpl` (`app.cpp`) owns the top-level subsystems and wires the callbacks in
`AppImpl::Init`:

```
DaisyTimeSource _time_source; // injected clock (ITimeSource) for the engine
GranularEngine  _engine;      // the active DSP engine, driven through IEngine
CoreUI          _ui;          // platform: controls, LEDs, pads, MIDI, storage UI
Hardware        _hw;          // Daisy peripherals and board I/O
Settings        _settings;    // calibration data in QSPI flash
Storage         _storage;     // SD-card samples + text config
```

`_engine` is the concrete engine member (today `GranularEngine`; section 4 covers selection);
the platform drives it only through the `IEngine` interface. Four execution contexts run
concurrently, ordered here from highest to lowest timing priority:

1. **Audio callback** - `AppImpl::ProcessAudio` (48 kHz / 96 frames, ~500 us per block).
   Reads analog controls, ticks the UI's per-block needs (`_ui.tick`, `_ui.read_cv`), then
   runs `_engine.process`. This is the hard real-time path: no allocation, no blocking, no SD
   or flash access.
2. **DAC callback** - `DACCallback`. Calls `_engine.process_cv(cv0, cv1, n)` **once per block**
   to fill the two modulation/LFO CV channels (block-rate by design, so the ISR pays no
   per-sample virtual dispatch), converts to the DAC's 12-bit range, and feeds the UI's LFO
   display the block's last sample.
3. **TIM5 timer ISR** - `T5Callback` at 250 Hz. Polls the gate inputs and renders LEDs
   (every fourth call, so LEDs refresh at ~62 Hz).
4. **Main loop** - `AppImpl::Loop`. Runs non-real-time work: `CoreUI::process` (pads,
   MIDI, switches, value display, gate out), `_engine.prepare`, `Storage::process`
   (the cooperative SD state machine), and the "boot button held 3s -> reset to
   bootloader" check.

The deliberate split is that **SD-card and flash I/O live only in the main loop**, never
in the audio path, and large buffers are pre-allocated up front so the audio path never
allocates. The main risk in this model is that the main loop and the audio callback
share data (deck/UI state) without locks; correctness relies on the audio path only
reading parameter snapshots and on writes being word-sized. See the review for the race
analysis.

```

`CoreUI` is the only subsystem that talks to both `Hardware` and the engine, but it reaches
the engine *only through `IEngine`* (with the residual `core()` exception noted in section 3).
It translates hardware events into musical actions on the engine, reads engine state back to
drive LEDs and gate/MIDI outputs, and drives `Storage` for the SD-card UI. The engine (and the
`Core` it owns) does not know about hardware; `Core` is a self-contained DSP graph fed
parameters and producing samples. `Storage` holds the engine through `IEngine*` and the engine
through the `audio_*` byte-port, not a `Deck*`.

## 7. Core DSP graph (the granular engine's private DSP)

`Core` (`src/core/core.cpp`) is the DSP graph owned privately by `GranularEngine`; it is not a
shared platform layer. It holds the two decks plus the shared `Driver`, `XFade` (the
A/B crossfade mix), `Click`, `Panner`, and a per-deck `Modulator`. The per-sample signal
flow in `Core::process` is, conceptually:

```
in[L,R] --route--> Deck A.process_out --> panner --\
                                                    >-- XFade(mix) --> +click --> SoftLimit --> out[L,R]
in[L,R] --route--> Deck B.process_out --> panner --/
```

with a cross-record feedback path: each deck's input for recording can be the external
input or the *other* deck's output, selected by `Deck::Source` (external/internal), which
is what enables cross-deck recording and resampling. The `Route` enum (DoubleMono,
Stereo, GenerativeStereo) selects the input topology and, via `infer_panner_mode`, the
panner behaviour.

### Clock / transport

`Driver` (`src/core/driver.cpp`) is the transport. `SynClock` runs a 48-PPQN internal
timeline that can phase-lock to an external 4-PPQN (TRS) or 24-PPQN (MIDI) source using
fractional tick accumulation and a tempo-adjustment feedback loop. `Tempo` provides
tap-tempo (averaged, with outlier rejection, clamped 20-250 BPM). `Divider` turns the
PPQN stream into musical triggers (default 1/16, with swing/triplet options). The driver
distributes ticks to both decks and to the modulators, fires "key" and "quarter"
callbacks used by the UI for LEDs and clock-out, and converts incoming TRS clock to
outgoing MIDI clock.

> The platform drives transport through the engine's `transport_*` forwards rather than
> reaching `Driver` directly; `Driver` still physically lives in `Core` pending the transport
> relocation noted in section 3.

### Deck

Each `Deck` (`src/core/deck.cpp`) is a complete looper voice:

- `Buffer` - the loop buffer with a record/overdub state machine (idle/fadein/sustain/
  fadeout, 4 ms Hann fades) and feedback-controlled overdub. Reads use linear or cubic
  interpolation for pitch-shifted playback.
- `Generator` + `Vox` - the granular engine. The generator owns start/size/spread/
  pitch/speed, slicing (manual and automatic), and reverse, and runs up to
  `kVoxCount` (3) voices, each managing several overlapping windowed grains. Mode
  (Reel/Slice/Drift) selects linear-vs-spread grain behaviour and tape-vs-digital speed
  semantics.
- `Track` - a per-deck step sequencer recording `Event`s (note plus parameter locks)
  onto a fixed grid; patterns persist across mode changes.
- `Dispatcher` - polyphonic voice allocation between the sequencer/clock events and the
  granular voices, with a "hold" voice for monophonic modes.
- `Fx` - the per-deck Grit (Drive = overdrive, or Reduce = decimator/bitcrush) and Flux
  (echo delay) effects, each soft-switched on/off.
- `Detector` - onset detection used to auto-start recording at the -40 dB threshold.

### Modulation

Per deck, a `Modulator` wraps an `LFO` (sine/square/saw/sample-and-hold) and a
`Follower` (envelope follower on the deck output). It can free-run (0.01-12 Hz) or sync
to musical divisions (1/32 to 4 bars). Its output drives both an internal modulation
target (loop start/size, pitch, mix) and the physical mod CV output via the DAC callback.

## 8. Memory model

All large buffers live in external SDRAM and are handed out once at init by the
`SDRAMBuffer::pool()` singleton (`src/hw/buffer.sdram.cpp`):

- Per-deck source (loop) buffers sized for `kSourceMaxSeconds` (42 s) of stereo audio,
  plus a third source buffer.
- Per-deck/per-channel detector and delay (echo) buffers.
- Per-deck slice-point arrays and `Track` event buffers.
- A 32 KB staging buffer for SD-card chunked I/O.

The platform pulls these pointers from the pool, packs them into the `EngineBuffers` of an
`EngineContext` (section 3), and passes that to `engine.init`; the engine then routes them
into each deck through a `Deck::Params` struct. Decks and effects never allocate their own
large storage. Smaller state lives in the objects themselves (statically allocated).
Calibration data persists in QSPI flash via `Settings` and libDaisy's `PersistentStorage`;
user config (MIDI channels, preload) persists as `SK/config.txt` on the SD card and is parsed
by `Config`.

The application boots from SRAM; code lives in the 186 KB `SRAM_EXEC` region, which is the
binding memory constraint (hundreds of bytes free) - any added abstraction surface must watch
it. See [refactor-status.md](refactor-status.md) for the running budget.

## 9. Control and persistence flow

- **Pots/sliders**: read in the audio callback, debounced/smoothed by libDaisy
  `PotMonitor`, enqueued onto a `UiEventQueue`, drained in the main loop, and applied to
  the engine through `MValue` wrappers (pickup/catch behaviour to avoid parameter jumps) that
  call `engine.set_param(ParamId, deck, value)`. The platform owns the pickup mechanics; the
  engine owns what each `ParamId` does.
- **Pads**: MPR121 touch polled in the main loop; touch/release dispatched through
  callbacks into `CoreUI`, which encodes the short/long/hold and Alt-combination
  gestures and routes them to `engine.on_*_pad`/`set_fx`/`on_seq_*`.
- **CV**: read per audio block; the platform reads + calibrates each jack and calls
  `engine.cv_*`; V/oct is mapped to speed via an engine-owned `SpeedMap`.
- **Storage**: SD operations are a cooperative state machine driven from the main loop;
  `init_*` operations and config/preload reads are blocking but bounded and only happen
  outside the audio path. The most-recent sample per deck can auto-preload on boot. `Storage`
  saves/loads the engine's loop buffer through the `audio_*` byte-port on `IEngine`.

## 10. Conventions

- Most non-trivial classes are non-copyable via the `NOCOPY` macro (`src/nocopy.h`).
- Several services are singletons: `SDRAMBuffer::pool`, `Config::dynamic`,
  `Expose::values` (debug value printing), `Meter::cpu` (CPU load metering).
- `infrasonic` namespace (`common.h`) holds shared math/log helpers and the `INFS_*`
  macros; logging compiles out unless built with `DEBUG=1`.
- Dotted filenames denote variants of a concept: `fx.drive.cpp`, `fx.reduce.cpp`,
  `core.ui.midi.cpp`, `random.lfo.h`.
