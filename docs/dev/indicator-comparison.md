# Indicator usage across engines — a comparison

Companion to [`indicator-grammar.md`](indicator-grammar.md), which reverse-engineers the full
indicator vocabulary from the reference `granular` engine. This document asks the follow-up
question: **do the other engines actually use that vocabulary, or are they leaving capability on the
table?**

Short answer: **most engines use a small fraction of what the panel can express.** The rich grammar
(mode-hued arcs, position/grain dots, red pickup-deviation overlays, breathe, clock-locked blink, the
eight named per-deck indicators, storage rings) is almost entirely a `granular` phenomenon. Own-display
engines converge on a common minimal dialect — *level arc + pitch/position dot + play dot + mode
LEDs* — and a couple (`softcut`, `shuttle`, `chuck`) go further but **re-implement** platform
features rather than reuse them.

---

## 1. Two rendering paths (why usage splits the way it does)

There are two ways an engine's indicators reach the LEDs (`src/ui/core.ui.leds.cpp`,
`src/engine/iengine.h`):

- **Co-authored (granular only, plus its clone `graincloud`).** `capabilities()` does *not* set
  `CapOwnDisplay`. The engine reports *semantics* (`deck_leds/fx_leds/play_leds/alt_leds/mix/route`
  + `render_ring()`); the **platform** owns the palette, breathe/blink timers, the knob-value
  "deviation" pickup overlays (`_show_value`), storage rings, and all eight named indicators. This
  path is where the full grammar lives.
- **Own-display (every other engine).** `capabilities()` sets `CapOwnDisplay`. The engine fills a
  `DisplayModel` in `render()` and the platform **blits it verbatim** (`_blit_display()`), doing *no*
  palette/blink/value interpretation. The engine gets a blank canvas and must draw everything itself.

The consequence is structural, not incidental: **an own-display engine that wants breathe, blink,
value-pickup feedback, or storage animation has to re-code it**, because those live in the platform's
granular path. Most don't bother — hence the thin dialect below.

## 2. What's on offer (the grammar, from `indicator-grammar.md`)

| Capability | Primitive / field | Meaning in granular |
|---|---|---|
| Ring arc | `ring[].set_segment()` | loop region, level, progress, value bar |
| Ring dots | `ring[].add_point()` / `set_point()` | playheads, targets, step ticks, slot markers |
| Two-layer color | `set_hex_color` + `set_point_hex_color` | arc hue vs dot hue, additive overlay |
| Breathe | brightness = `0.7+sin·0.15` | idle / alive |
| Value pickup overlay | `_show_value` (platform) | red deviation arc + target dot on knob turn |
| Blink | `_clock_led_on` / timers | sync-locked vs free vs fast-clear |
| **8 named per-deck LEDs** | `play rev grit flux gate_in cycle alt fader` | transport, FX, LFO, gate, modifier, crossfade |
| 5 global LEDs | `mode_left/center/right`, `clock_in`, `spot` | route topology, clock source, system |
| Color as identity | mode/FX/clock/tape palettes | hue = meaning |

## 3. Usage matrix

Counts are raw references to each `DisplayModel` field / `LEDRing` primitive in an engine's
`render()` (a proxy for "does it use this at all", not a quality score). Faust engines
(`chorus/filter/voice` and others) inherit render from `faust/faust_chain.h` / `faust_fx.h`.

`*` = co-authored path (query structs, not `render()`; breathe/blink/value overlays supplied by the
platform).

**The columns that are all-zero across every own-display engine tell the story:**
`grit`, `flux`, `gate_in`, `cycle`, `alt`, `fader`, `clock_in`, `spot` — **eight of the panel's
indicators are used by *no* own-display engine.** `rev` is used by exactly one (`edrums`).

## 4. Per-engine notes

### reso (the requested engine)
`render()` at `src/engine/reso/reso_engine.cpp:289`. Draws, per deck:
- **arc** = envelope level meter (`level·1.5` clamped), in a local 3-color mode palette
  (`0xffcc00 / 0x00aaff / 0xaa00ff` — note these are *re-declared constants*, close to but not equal
  to the platform's `kReelColor/kSliceColor/kDriftColor`);
- **one white dot** = pitch position, or, while Alt+PITCH is held, **5 evenly-spaced dots** = the
  resonator-model selector with the active model bright;
- **play** indicator = mode color, flashed on trigger via a manual `flash` down-counter;
- **mode L/C/R** = the three model/mode colors, active one bright.

It's a clean, representative member of the minimal dialect. What it does **not** do, though the panel
supports it: no breathe on idle, no value feedback when you turn Size/Structure/Brightness/Damping
(you turn a knob and the ring shows nothing), no clock indicator despite `CapTransport`, and it hand-
rolls a mode palette instead of sharing one.

### mosc, delay, qdelay, tape, reverb, glitch, pstretch, radio, csound
All variations on *level/activity arc + a dot or two + play + mode LEDs*. `radio` and `glitch` and
`pstretch` add expressive dots (spectral/scan/grain positions). `csound`/`chuck` add an Alt-held
**patch selector** ring (dots per program) — the same idiom `reso` uses for models and
`softcut/shuttle` use for tape slots, each **implemented independently**.

### chuck
The richest `render()` (most primitive calls): patch-selector ring, running/stopped play color,
per-deck arcs and dots. Still confined to ring + play + mode; no breathe/blink/named-LED use.

### softcut & shuttle (the "reinventors")
These go furthest — and in doing so **duplicate platform capability**:
- **Own breathe**: a raised-cosine `0.35+0.25·…` over `now_ms()%2400` (`softcut_engine.cpp`,
  `shuttle_engine.cpp`) — a hand-rolled copy of the platform's `_breathe_led()`.
- **Own storage-slot ring**: an Alt-held tape-slot selector (selected bright / used mid / empty dim)
  — a hand-rolled copy of the platform's `_show_slots()` / storage progress ring.
- **Direction-coded transport color** (record red / fwd green / rev cyan / frozen white) packed into
  the play dot + ring, instead of the dedicated `rev` LED that exists for exactly this.

They are the *best-looking* non-granular engines precisely because they re-created features the
platform already has — evidence the capability is desirable and the reuse path is missing.

### edrums
The only own-display engine to light a second named LED (`rev`), used as a second trigger/deck
indicator. No mode LEDs. Shows the named indicators *can* be driven from `render()` — nobody else does.

### chorus, filter, voice (and other Faust engines)
Inherit `render()` from `faust/faust_chain.h:122` / `faust_fx.h:153`: a level-meter arc + play dot,
**compile-time gated by `Traits::meter`**. If a Faust engine's manifest doesn't set `meter`, its
panel is entirely dark. This is the floor of the spectrum.

---

## 5. Findings — where capability is left on the table

1. **Eight indicators are dead for every engine but granular.** `grit`, `flux`, `gate_in`, `cycle`,
   `alt`, `fader`, `clock_in`, `spot` are never set outside the granular path. Some are granular-
   specific by label (grit/flux), but `cycle` (an LFO/mod indicator), `fader` (A/B balance),
   `clock_in` (sync source), and `alt` (modifier feedback) are **generic** and would be meaningful on
   many engines — e.g. `reso/softcut` have `CapTransport` but show no clock, `mosc/reso` have LFO-ish
   params but no `cycle` glow.

2. **No knob-value feedback off the granular path.** The platform's `_show_value` pickup overlay (the
   red deviation arc + target dot that makes granular's knobs legible, and the whole tracking/pickup
   UX) is keyed off `MValue`/`ParamId` inside the platform's `_draw_ring`. Own-display engines get
   **none of it**: turning a knob on reso/mosc/tape/etc. produces no visual response at all. This is
   the single biggest expressive gap.

3. **Breathe / blink must be re-coded.** Only `softcut` and `shuttle` bother, by copying the math.
   Everyone else has a static (often black-when-idle) panel. "Idle but ready" vs "off" is
   indistinguishable on most engines.

4. **Palette duplication.** Mode colors are re-declared per engine (`reso`'s `0xffcc00…` vs the
   platform's `kReelColor 0xf7941d…`), so hues drift between engines and none share the tape/clock
   palettes. The grammar's "hue = identity" only holds *within* an engine.

5. **Selector-ring idiom reinvented 5×.** The Alt-held "dots around the ring, active one bright"
   pattern appears independently in reso (models), chuck/csound (patches), softcut/shuttle (slots).
   It's clearly a common need with no shared helper.

6. **The floor is dark.** Faust engines with `meter=false` show nothing; `passthrough` shows only a
   level arc + play. Nothing signals mode, activity, or readiness.

## 6. Recommendations

> **Status:** recommendations 1–3 are now implemented in **`src/engine/indicators.h`** — a shared,
> hardware-free helper toolkit any engine's `render()` can call (value-pickup overlay, breathe/blink,
> selector/slot/progress/level rings, the direction-coded transport color, and the canonical
> palette). API + a best-use example are in [`indicator-grammar.md` §8](indicator-grammar.md#8-shared-helper-api-engineindicatorsh).
> What remains is #4–#5 (migrating each engine's `render()` onto it) and lifting the platform's
> `core.ui.leds.cpp` constants onto `pal::`.

Ordered by leverage:

1. **Lift the value-pickup overlay into a shared, engine-callable helper.** The `_show_value`
   deviation/pickup rendering is the highest-value missing feature for own-display engines. Expose it
   as a `DisplayModel`/`LEDRing` utility (e.g. `draw_value(ring, value, in_value, color)`) that any
   `render()` can call, so knob turns become legible everywhere — not just granular.

2. **Provide shared platform helpers for breathe, the selector-ring, and progress/storage rings.**
   `softcut`/`shuttle` prove the demand and the shape; promote their (and the platform's) copies to
   one reusable set so engines stop hand-rolling `now_ms()` cosines and slot loops.

3. **Publish the canonical palette** (`kReelColor`, mode/clock/tape hues) in a shared header engines
   include, replacing per-engine constants — restores "hue = identity" across the whole instrument.

4. **Wire the generic named indicators from `render()`.** At minimum drive `clock_in` for
   `CapTransport` engines and `fader` for `CapDualDeck` engines with a balance; consider `cycle` for
   engines with an LFO. `edrums` already shows named LEDs are reachable from `render()`.

5. **Give Faust engines a non-blank default.** Even without `meter`, a mode-hued idle breathe + play
   dot would lift the floor.

The theme: the grammar is rich but **trapped in the platform's granular path**. Turning its key
pieces (value feedback, breathe, selector/progress rings, palette) into shared helpers callable from
`render()` would let every own-display engine speak the full language instead of the current pidgin.
