# Dev notes — Csound as an sk-engines engine (`ENGINE=csound`)

Running [Csound](https://csound.com) 7 as a synthesis engine on Daisy hardware. Csound is a runtime audio compiler/interpreter: an orchestra (`.csd` / `.orc` text) is compiled at runtime and performed. This engine wraps it behind the real sk-engines `IEngine` contract.

It is **not** an SRAM engine. Csound's linked code is ~2 MB — far over the 186 KB `SRAM_EXEC` budget — so it runs as a **`BOOT_QSPI`** app (code executes in place from QSPI flash). Everything else about the contract (params, display, pads) is the same as any other engine; only the memory/boot model differs.

**Status (2026-06-18): working on real hardware, incl. SD patches + MIDI.** Csound synthesizes on the **spotykach** board from QSPI, driven through `IEngine` — panel controls move the synth, the rings show an output level meter, the Play LEDs show running state. **SD patch loading and live switching (#1/#5) and MIDI-in (#3) are verified on hardware**: an SD `/csound/<n>.csd` orchestra boots/auto-loads, the Alt+PITCH selector recompiles patches live, and MIDI NoteOn plays the patch's `MidiNote` instrument. Also runs on a **Daisy Pod** (the quick-iterate board). The whole chain is proven: cross-compiled `libcsound.a`, QSPI execution, the dual-heap fix, the free-capable SDRAM allocator, audio, controls, panel, SD, MIDI. (The remaining open item is #4, the QSPI-XIP CPU performance pass.)

---

## Quick start

Build + flash the spotykach (board in DFU before the build finishes; one `dfu-util`, no retry loop):

```
make engine-csound      # clean + build the QSPI image + flash
make program-csound      # re-flash the last build without rebuilding
```

Both expand to `ENGINE=csound APP_TYPE=BOOT_QSPI LDSCRIPT=alt_qspi.lds` + the core `program-dfu` (`dfu-util -a 0 -s 0x90040000:leave -D build/spotykach.bin -d ,0483:df11`). The leading `-` on the flash step swallows the benign `Error 74` (the `get_status` on the QSPI `:leave` — the write succeeds).

Prerequisite, once: build `libcsound.a` (see "Building libcsound.a" below). Recover the board anytime by flashing any normal engine.

**Loading patches (optional).** Drop full CSD documents at `/csound/0.csd` .. `/csound/7.csd` on the SD card — ready-to-copy examples live in `examples/csound/` (`0.csd`, `1.csd`, + a README). The engine boots into the lowest-numbered one (or the built-in if the card has none) and presents the **built-in plus every present slot** as a bank: **hold Alt and turn PITCH** to scroll the selector (a dot per patch around the rings), **release** to compile the chosen one live (the centre mode LED turns cyan for an SD patch, white for the built-in). A patch should `chnget` the engine's control channels (`speedA`/`mixA`/`sizeA`/`envA`/`fbA`/`modspA`/`modampA`, and the `B` deck) to be driven by the panel knobs, and define `instr MidiNote` (p4 = freq Hz) to be keyboard-playable — see `kOrchestra` in `csound_engine.cpp` for the template, or the official orchestras in `thirdparty/csound/Daisy/DaisyCsoundExamples/`. No card, no file, a non-CSD file, or one that fails to compile all fall back to the built-in, so the engine always makes sound.

**CSD format (matters — Csound's CSD parser is line-oriented):** each section tag must be on its **own line** — `<CsScore>` and `</CsScore>` on separate lines, **not** `<CsScore></CsScore>` (a one-line empty section makes the parser miss the closing tag and the compile fails). Use the structure the Daisy examples use:

```
<CsoundSynthesizer>
<CsOptions>
</CsOptions>
<CsInstruments>
  ; sr/0dbfs/nchnls, your instr 1.. and instr MidiNote
</CsInstruments>
<CsScore>
</CsScore>
</CsoundSynthesizer>
```

The engine normalizes a leading UTF-8 BOM and CRLF line endings on read (a card file authored on Windows has both; a compiled-in string never does), so those won't trip the compile. Other constraints: ≤ 64 KB, core opcodes only — no plugins or soundfile I/O (see Limitations).

## How Csound maps onto IEngine

`CsoundEngine : public IEngine` (`src/engine/csound/csound_engine.{h,cpp}`) overrides only what it uses; everything else keeps the no-op defaults.

- `init(ctx)` → arm the SDRAM allocator (see below) → `rescan_bank()` (probe `/csound/<n>.csd`) → pick the boot orchestra (first SD slot if any, else the built-in `kOrchestra`) → `build_instance()`: `csoundCreate` / `csoundSetHostAudioIO` / options (`-n`, `--ksmps` from `ctx.block_size`, `-dm0`) / `csoundCompileCSD(text,1,0)` / `csoundStart` → publish to the `ReloadGate`. A failed SD compile retries with the built-in so a bad card never costs audio.

- `set_aux_active(deck, held)` + `set_param(Aux, …)` → the **patch selector**. While Alt is held on deck A, PITCH previews a bank index (`aux_to_index`); on release, a changed choice is queued and `prepare()` recompiles it live — `ReloadGate.take()` pulls the old instance out of the audio path, `csoundDestroy` reclaims its SDRAM (roadmap #2), the new orchestra compiles, cached knob values are reseeded into it, then `publish()` hands it back to the ISR. The whole recompile is on the main loop; the ISR sees silence for the gap.

- `process(in, out, n)` → de-interleave `in`→`spin`, `csoundPerformKsmps`, `spout`→de-interleave `out`, and track an output peak for the meter. `ksmps == block`, so one k-cycle per block.

- `set_param(id, deck, v)` → `csoundSetControlChannel(name, v)`; the orchestra reads it with `chnget`. `channel_for()` maps `ParamId::Speed/Mix/Size/Env` (+ deck) → channel names (`speedA`, `mixA`, …). **The orchestra is the param vocabulary** — swap the `.csd`, swap the synth, no C++ change.

- `handle_midi_note(channel, note)` → channel picks the deck (the platform's configured MIDI channels), `note` becomes a frequency, and a Csound event instantiates the orchestra's `MidiNote` instrument (`csoundEvent(CS_INSTR_EVENT, {instr,0,dur,freq,deck})`). The platform delivers **NoteOn only** (no NoteOff, no velocity), so notes are finite/self-terminating. Because `handle_midi_note` runs in the main loop and `csoundPerformKsmps` in the audio ISR, the handler only **enqueues** onto a lock-free SPSC ring (`csound_midi.h`); `process()` drains it inside the ISR right before performing, so all Csound allocation stays single-threaded (no race on the SDRAM pool). A patch opts into being keyboard-playable by defining `instr MidiNote`; the engine looks it up by name (`csoundGetInstrNumber`) and drops MIDI when it's absent.

- `render(m)` → both rings show the output level meter (and, while Alt is held, the patch selector: a dot per selectable orchestra, the previewed one bright); Play indicators show running state; the centre mode LED tells the patch source. `capabilities() = CapAux | CapOwnDisplay`.

The orchestra is loaded from the card when a numbered slot `/csound/<n>.csd` is present (a full CSD document), else it is the compiled-in `kOrchestra` in `csound_engine.cpp`: a `vco2` saw drone (knob1→pitch, knob2→level, knob3→cutoff, triggered by `schedule(1,0,100000)`) plus an `instr MidiNote` (a finite `vco2` pluck reading p4=freq) so the built-in is keyboard-playable out of the box. An SD patch should name the same control channels (`speedA`/`mixA`/`sizeA`/`envA`/`fbA`/`modspA`/`modampA` and the `B` deck) so the platform knobs drive it, and define `instr MidiNote` to be MIDI-playable; see `channel_for()` and `kMidiInstrName`. The centre mode LED shows the source: cyan = SD patch, white = built-in.

### The heap (the thing that took the longest)

Two heaps, deliberately:
- The **platform's** default heap stays in **SRAM** (`alt_qspi.lds`). It must — global constructors `malloc` *before* `_hw.Init()` powers up the SDRAM controller, so a heap in SDRAM faults there.

- **Csound's** heap is a 12 MB **SDRAM pool** (`src/engine/csound/csound_alloc.cpp`), reached by linking `--wrap=malloc/free/calloc/realloc` and gating on a flag that `CsoundEngine::init()` arms (`csound_heap_arm()`) *after* `_hw.Init()`. Csound's MBs at create/compile land in SDRAM; the platform's allocations stay in SRAM. The pool is a **free-capable coalescing allocator** (`CsoundPool`, `src/engine/csound/csound_pool.h`) — a boundary-tag allocator with segregated free lists — so `free`/`realloc` reclaim and coalesce, and a `csoundReset` + recompile returns its megabytes to the pool (this is what makes patch-swapping sustainable; it replaced the original bump pool, which never freed). On pool exhaustion the shim falls back to the SRAM heap so a request never hard-fails, and `in_pool()` routes each pointer's `free`/`realloc` back to whichever heap it came from. The allocator is host-tested in isolation (`make -C host test-csound-alloc`), since it has no `libcsound` dependency.

---

## Memory & boot model

- Code in **QSPI flash** (`0x90040000`, 8 MB), executed in place. Data/bss in SRAM/DTCM; Csound heap in the SDRAM pool; platform heap in SRAM.

- `alt_qspi.lds` = `alt_sram.lds` with code + `.data` load-address moved `SRAM_EXEC → QSPIFLASH`. The abandoned `alt_qspi_csound.lds` (heap-in-SDRAM via the linker) is gone — it caused the ctor crash above.

- `csound-poc/spotykach_qspi_vtor.cpp` — an `init_priority(101)` global ctor that sets `SCB->VTOR = 0x90040000`. Needed because the startup skips `SystemInit` under `BOOT_APP` and the bootloader may not point the vector table at the QSPI app; without it SysTick + audio DMA are dead.

**Bootloader fact (verified):** the spotykach `v2` bootloader **runs QSPI apps** — proved by building `radio` as `BOOT_QSPI` and booting it on the board. Both `BOOT_SRAM` and `BOOT_QSPI` apps flash to the same `0x90040000` via the same Daisy DFU; the bootloader decides copy-to-SRAM vs run-in-place from the app's vectors. So no bootloader change is needed to run Csound on the spotykach.

## Building `libcsound.a`

`thirdparty/csound/` is Csound 7 with the official `Daisy/` port (toolchain, `Custom.cmake`, examples, linker script, v5.4 bootloader). Needs `arm-none-eabi-gcc` + CMake:

```
cd thirdparty/csound
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../Daisy \
         -DCUSTOM_CMAKE=../Daisy/Custom.cmake \
         -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../Daisy/crosscompile.cmake
make -j && make install
```

Installs `libcsound.a` (single precision, bare-metal) + headers to `thirdparty/csound/Daisy/{lib,include}`. `thirdparty/csound/` is gitignored (115 MB); rebuild from this recipe. The `ENGINE=csound` Makefile branch points `-I` / link at `thirdparty/csound/Daisy/{include,lib}`.

The **Pod** dev target (`csound-poc/`, bare `DaisySeed`, no front panel) predates the spotykach build; keep it for quick iteration. It needs `thirdparty/csound/Daisy/{libDaisy,DaisySP}` symlinked to `lib/`.

---

## Debugging (SWD / ST-Link)

There is **no console** in the QSPI build (see the Gotchas), so bring-up has been done with audio as the debug signal. A SWD probe (ST-Link V2/V3, or a J-Link) is a large upgrade for the failures that audio can't show — pre-`main` ctor crashes, hardfaults, ISR hangs, and `csound*` return codes — and it is the recommended tool for the perf pass (roadmap #4) and any allocator/patch-swap crashes. The Daisy Seed exposes **SWDIO/SWCLK** pads; ST-Link + OpenOCD + Cortex-Debug (VS Code) works.

**QSPI execute-in-place changes the workflow** — it is not the usual "probe flashes and runs":

- **Attach, don't flash.** The ST-Link internal-flash loader can't place a `BOOT_QSPI` XIP image. Keep the DFU flow (`make engine-csound` / `program-csound`) to put the image at `0x90040000`, then **attach to the running target** and load symbols from `build/spotykach.elf`. The QSPI controller must already be in memory-mapped mode for the probe to read/step that code — the Daisy bootloader does this at boot, so attach **after** boot (or teach OpenOCD to init QSPI).
- **Hardware breakpoints only.** Software breakpoints patch a `BKPT` into the instruction, but QSPI code is memory-mapped read-only flash the debugger can't write through. You are limited to the Cortex-M7 FPB comparators (~6-8) — enough, but you can't place them freely.
- **Bootloader / `VTOR`.** The probe sees the app only after the bootloader hands off; the `spotykach_qspi_vtor.cpp` inject and the v2 bootloader don't interfere with a debug session.

**Highest-leverage uses here:** halt on the fault handler and read `CFSR`/`HFSR`/`BFAR` to pin a crash in seconds (the SDRAM-heap-vs-ctor bug was exactly this shape); break after `csoundStart` to inspect the return codes that are otherwise invisible; and inspect ftable/instr state for the silent-`ftgen` mystery.

**Cheaper first step (no soldering):** the platform already has a USB-CDC path (the `METER=1` meter). Wiring that same serial as a log channel for the csound build gets you compile status + `printf` for the *non-crash* questions; the probe earns its keep specifically for failures **before serial is up** (ctors, ISRs, hardfaults). Alternatively, SWO/ITM `printf` over the trace pin gives a console through the probe.

## Limitations & potential

### Opcodes — limited by *category*, not count

What ships in our `libcsound.a` is the **entire statically-linked core** opcode library (oscillators, filters, envelopes, delays, reverbs, the `pvs` spectral/FFT family, granular, waveguide/physical models, … — well over a thousand opcodes). The exclusions are structural, from `Daisy/Custom.cmake` + bare metal:

- **No plugin / external opcodes.** Desktop Csound `dlopen`s opcode libraries at runtime; bare metal has no dynamic loading, so only statically-compiled opcodes exist. (Biggest limit.)

- **No soundfile I/O** (`USE_LIBSNDFILE=OFF`): `diskin`/`soundin`/`fout`, `GEN01` (sample-from-WAV) are out. Table-generating GENs (GEN10 sine, etc.) work.

- **OSC and deprecated opcodes disabled**; MIDI-/audio-*device* opcodes gone (the host feeds I/O).

- Real ceilings: **CPU** (QSPI execute-in-place is slower than SRAM) and **memory** (the 12 MB pool).

To get the definitive list of registered opcodes for *this* build: `csoundNewOpcodeList`.

### vs desktop Csound

Same **language and core DSP**, minus the hosted-OS layer: single precision (`float`, not `double`); host does all I/O (`spin`/`spout` + control channels, no devices/disk); no filesystem, threads, plugins, utilities, or CLI; CPU/memory constrained. An orchestra built from core opcodes + compiled-in tables behaves *identically* within float precision and the CPU budget — it's real Csound, not a reduced dialect.

### Interpreter / patch-swapping — yes, with a caveat

Csound *is* a runtime interpreter: `csoundCompileOrc`/`csoundCompileCSD` compile orchestra text at runtime, and Csound supports **live recompilation** (add/replace instruments while playing). So we can compile a `.csd` from a string today, and from the **SD card** with a little wiring — a real patch player.

**Caveat (resolved):** the heap used to be a bump pool with no free, so compiling a fresh patch leaked MBs — a handful of swaps before the 12 MB pool exhausted. It is now a **free-capable coalescing allocator** (`CsoundPool`, roadmap #2 below, done), so `csoundReset` + recompile reclaims its memory and sustained patch-swapping is no longer pool-bound. What remains for live patch-swapping is the wiring in #1 (load `.csd` from SD and recompile) — the allocator dependency is cleared.

---

## Roadmap (next session)

Ordered by leverage. **#1, #2, #3, and #5 are done** (SD patches, the free-capable allocator, MIDI-in, and the patch bank + live switching + UI depth). The one remaining unknown — and the thing that now matters most — is **#4** (QSPI-XIP CPU headroom): every done feature (per-note allocation on MIDI, a full recompile on patch switch) leans on it. The done items are unit-proven off-target but **pending on-hardware verification** in the real Csound path (the live-recompile handoff and per-note events especially).

1. **SD-loaded `.csd` patches. — DONE.** `init()` reads a numbered slot `/csound/<n>.csd` from the card (`ctx.stream->read_text`) into a scratch buffer carved from the SDRAM pool, validates it looks like a CSD, and compiles it; absent/invalid/uncompilable falls back to the built-in `kOrchestra` (so a card-less unit always sounds). The selection logic is host-tested (`make -C host test-csound-patch`); the compile is QSPI-only. Live switching between slots is #5 (done).

2. [x] **Real SDRAM allocator. — DONE.** The bump pool in `src/engine/csound/csound_alloc.cpp` is replaced by `CsoundPool` (`src/engine/csound/csound_pool.h`): a boundary-tag coalescing allocator with segregated free lists, so `free`/`realloc` reclaim and coalesce and a `csoundReset` + recompile returns its memory to the pool. The `--wrap` + arm-in-init gating is unchanged; only the pool internals changed. Host-tested off-target (`make -C host test-csound-alloc`: alignment, splitting, forward/backward coalescing, in-place grow/shrink, exhaustion, and a 4000-op churn that drains back to a single max block). *Pending: on-hardware verification that a live patch recompile reclaims as expected (needs #1 to drive it).* If fragmentation ever bites under sustained swapping, swap the internals for TLSF behind the same interface.

3. **MIDI in. — DONE.** `handle_midi_note(channel, note)` resolves channel→deck (Config MIDI channels), maps `note`→Hz, and instantiates the orchestra's `MidiNote` instrument via `csoundEvent(CS_INSTR_EVENT, {instr,0,dur,freq,deck})`. Constraints from the platform: **NoteOn only, no velocity, no NoteOff** → notes are finite (a fixed-duration pluck; no hold/sustain). The handler runs in the main loop but Csound performs in the ISR, so it enqueues onto a lock-free SPSC ring (`csound_midi.h`) that `process()` drains in the ISR before `csoundPerformKsmps` — all Csound allocation stays single-threaded (closes the pool-concurrency hazard flagged in #2). Host-tested (`make -C host test-csound-midi`: note→Hz, p-field builder, ring FIFO/drop/wraparound, and a 200k-note cross-thread SPSC run); the `csoundEvent`/`csoundGetInstrNumber` calls compile against the real `csound.h` for ARM. *Pending: on-hardware confirmation that runtime events fire (the score-`i` gotcha was about the static score; `csoundEvent` is the realtime queue, but verify).* Not yet: sustain/NoteOff (the platform delivers neither), MIDI CC→channels, per-note velocity.

4. **Performance pass (do early — it sizes everything).** Measure CPU headroom from QSPI XIP with `make engine-csound METER=1` (the platform's CPU meter over USB serial). If a real orchestra glitches: raise `ksmps`, simplify, or pin hot code to ITCM/SRAM (hard for a static lib — investigate the linker moving Csound's hot `.text` into SRAM in the QSPI build, since SRAM_EXEC is free there).

5. **Control / UI depth. — DONE (mostly).** `channel_for()` expanded to 7 params/deck (Speed/Mix/Size/Env/Feedback/ModSpeed/ModAmp → `speedA`/`mixA`/…/`modampA` + `B`). **`CapAux` patch selection**: Alt+PITCH scrolls the SD bank (`/csound/0-7.csd` + the built-in), the rings draw the selector while held (`CapOwnDisplay`), and release commits a **live recompile** via the `ReloadGate` — `take()` (ISR → silence) / `csoundDestroy` (pool reclaims, #2) / build / `reseed_channels` / `publish()` (→ ISR). The bank scan / quantizer (`test-csound-patch`) and the lock-free ISR↔main handoff (`test-csound-reload`, incl. a concurrent use-after-free detector that caught a release/acquire StoreLoad bug → fixed with seq_cst) are host-tested; the engine TU compiles against the real `csound.h`. *Not done (deferred):* mapping pads → score events, and a patch-name readout in `render()` (the selector shows a dot index, not a name — names need a directory listing the HAL doesn't expose for `.csd`). *Pending hardware:* the destroy/recompile actually reclaiming + restarting cleanly on-device.

6. **Opcode audit.** Dump `csoundNewOpcodeList`, document the available set, and optionally static-link specific high-value plugin opcodes into the `Custom.cmake` build.

---

## Gotchas (each cost real debugging time)

- **FatFs paths must be relative (no leading slash).** `patch_path` first built `"/csound/0.csd"`; `f_open`/`f_stat` missed it because libDaisy mounts the SD at a volume-prefixed path (`FatFSInterface::GetSDPath`), so a bare leading `/` resolves to the wrong volume. The radio/tape/shuttle engines all use relative paths (`radio/…`, `tapes/…`) for this reason. Fix = `"csound/%d.csd"`. Symptom was the Alt+PITCH selector showing only the built-in (the scan found no slots) even with the card populated.

- **SD-file CSD vs a compiled-in string: BOM, CRLF, and section-tag formatting.** An SD patch that read fine and *looked* like a CSD (`strstr` found `<CsoundSynthesizer`) still failed `csoundCompileCSD`, where the byte-identical compiled-in `kOrchestra` compiled. Three differences a card file carries that a C string literal never does: a **UTF-8 BOM** (front-of-file bytes make the CSD parser miss the root tag), **CRLF** line endings (the line-oriented parser chokes on the stray `\r`), and a **one-line `<CsScore></CsScore>`** (the parser scans for a line that *is* `</CsScore>`, so an empty section collapsed onto one line is never closed). `read_orchestra` now starts the text at the `<CsoundSynthesizer` tag (strips a BOM/leading junk) and normalizes CRLF→LF; the section-tag formatting is a CSD-authoring rule (documented in "Loading patches", matching the Daisy examples). This was the long pole in bringing SD patches up on hardware — it presents as "valid CSD but compile fails", which the per-stage mode-LED instrumentation isolated.

- **SD patch loading needs `SPK_USE_STREAM` in the Makefile csound branch.** `ctx.stream` (the SD service) is only constructed + injected by `app.cpp` under `SPK_USE_STREAM`. The csound branch originally omitted it, so `ctx.stream` was null: `scan_patches` found no slots, the bank was built-in-only, and patches never loaded (the Alt+PITCH selector still drew - it just had one entry). The host tests missed it because they inject a fake `IStreamDeck` directly, exercising the load *logic* but not the platform *wiring*. Fix = `C_DEFS += -DSPK_USE_STREAM` in the csound branch (adds ~2 MB of SDRAM rings; ~62 MB of the 64 MB used). Lesson: a feature that depends on an injected platform service needs an on-target wiring check, not just host-logic tests.

- **The SDRAM-heap-vs-ctor crash.** A heap in SDRAM (`alt_qspi_csound.lds`) crashed at boot: global ctors `malloc` before `_hw.Init()` powers up the FMC. Fix = dual heap (platform SRAM + Csound's `--wrap`'d SDRAM pool armed after init). This is the central lesson; see "The heap" above.

- **Bootloader v5.4 (Pod) / v2 (spotykach), not v6.4.** v6.4 doesn't point VTOR at the QSPI app → dead interrupts. The `spotykach_qspi_vtor.cpp` inject makes the app bootloader-agnostic; v5.4/v2 work. v6.4 (not well tested)

- **Bare `DaisySeed`, not `DaisyPod`** on the Pod — DaisyPod init left audio silent. (The spotykach build uses the platform's own `_hw` init, which is correct for that board.)

- **Trigger instruments with `schedule(...)` in the orchestra, not a score `i` event** (the score event didn't fire → silence).

- **Prefer table-less oscillators** (`vco2`, `oscils`); `poscil`+`ftgen` was silent (ftgen-at-init still unexplained — worth revisiting).

- **Large `ksmps`** (>=128; 256 proven). At `ksmps=32` Csound's per-cycle overhead overruns the audio ISR.

- **No console.** With no serial, use audio as the debug signal (synthesize a C tone to test the boot/output path; a distinct pitch as a "compile failed" flag).
