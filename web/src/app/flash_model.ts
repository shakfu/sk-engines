// flash_model.ts - the Flash tab's state, and the only place that decides what may be written.
//
// The split is deliberate and structural. `core/dfu.ts` implements DFU faithfully and will write
// whatever address it is given, because a protocol implementation that argues with its caller is a
// worse protocol implementation. This file is the caller, and it will only ever name one address.
//
// WHY THIS IS DEFENSIBLE AT ALL. `web/README.md` kept flashing out of scope on the grounds that "a
// half-written image is the worst failure in the system". That is true of the general case and not of
// this one, and the difference is worth stating because it is the whole argument:
//
//   - The app lives in QSPI at 0x90040000. The BOOTLOADER lives in internal flash at 0x08000000, and
//     nothing here can address it: APP_ADDRESS is a constant, not a field, and `assertTarget` below
//     rejects everything else before a single USB transfer happens.
//   - So the worst outcome of an interrupted write is a device with a corrupt APP and an intact
//     bootloader - which still enters DFU on a 3-second Reset hold, and can simply be flashed again.
//     That is a retry, not a brick.
//   - The images identify themselves (core/image.ts), so the page refuses a bootloader binary and can
//     name the engine and version it is about to install instead of showing a filename.
//   - The write is read back and compared where the device supports UPLOAD, so "it flashed" is a
//     measurement rather than an inference.
//
// What this does NOT do, and will not: install a bootloader. That is the one operation whose failure
// is unrecoverable without hardware, it is a once-per-device procedure, and `build_release.py` calls
// it "deliberately not documented here". The page says so where somebody would look for it.
