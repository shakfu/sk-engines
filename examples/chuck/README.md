# ChucK engine example patches

Reference programs for the `chuck` engine (`ENGINE=chuck`). Each is a complete, self-contained `.ck`
program that compiles on the Daisy build and reads the panel knobs.

## Use

Copy the files into a `chuck/` folder at the **root of the SD card**, keeping the numbered names:

```
<card>/chuck/0.ck
<card>/chuck/1.ck
<card>/chuck/2.ck
<card>/chuck/3.ck
```

Boot the unit (with the `chuck` firmware flashed): it auto-loads the lowest-numbered patch. **Hold Alt
and turn PITCH** to scroll the selector (a dot per patch around the rings); **release** to switch live
(the engine `removeAllShreds()` + recompiles). The centre mode LED is cyan for an SD patch, white for
the built-in.

- `0.ck` — clean two-saw "fifth" drone (calm baseline, knob-controlled).
- `1.ck` — fat detuned super-saw with a sub-octave (obviously different, for testing live switching).
- `2.ck` — **concurrent generative pad**: several voice shreds play themselves in polyrhythm. The patch
  that shows off ChucK's strongly-timed concurrency; on a `METER=1` build ring B (the shred count) shows
  several dots instead of one.
- `3.ck` — STK **Rhodey** auto-arpeggio, showing the STK instruments are available, not just the raw
  oscillators.

All four are self-running (sound immediately, no MIDI). MIDI-driven patches arrive with M4.

## Writing your own

Globals the panel drives (declare and read them): `speedA` (PITCH), `mixA` (MIX), `sizeA` (SIZE),
`envA`, `fbA`, `modspA`, `modampA`, and the `B`-deck equivalents. A program reads whichever globals it
declares; the rest are ignored. The convention across these patches is PITCH = pitch/tempo, SIZE =
brightness, MIX = level - keep to it so the knobs feel consistent when you switch patches.

What is and isn't available (this is a bare-metal, core-only ChucK build):
- **Available:** the oscillators (`SinOsc`/`SawOsc`/`SqrOsc`/`TriOsc`/`PulseOsc`/`Noise`), filters
  (`LPF`/`HPF`/`BPF`/`ResonZ`/...), envelopes (`ADSR`/`Envelope`), `Gain`, delays, the reverbs
  (`JCRev`/`NRev`/`PRCRev`), the FFT/analysis UANAs, and the **STK instruments** (`Rhodey`, `Wurley`,
  `TubeBell`, `Mandolin`, `Moog`, ...). `Math`/`Std`, sporked shreds, events, and global variables.
- **Not available:** chugins (no dynamic loading), sound-file I/O (`SndBuf`/`WvIn`/`WvOut` - no
  filesystem audio), and MIDI/OSC/HID/serial device UGens (the host owns I/O).

Keep an eye on CPU: every concurrent shred and UGen costs time inside one audio block. The `METER=1`
build's ring A (CPU load) tells you how close you are to the budget - stay out of the red. A UTF-8 BOM
and CRLF line endings are tolerated (the engine normalizes them); an empty or whitespace-only file
falls back to the built-in.
