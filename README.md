# Spotykach
The official firmware for the [Spotykach](https://synthux.academy/store/spotykach).

## Setup

Clone the repo recursively or run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
to update submodules (libDaisy + DaisySP)

Note that the ws2812 driver requires a slight modification to libDaisy,
as such the libDaisy submodule commit ref points at a specific branch within
the bleeptools fork (which is based on Infrasonic Audio fork), containing a few other modifications as well, namely
within the MIDI and mpr121 classes.

## Compiling the Firmware

First you must build the libraries. For convenience there is a target in the `Makefile` for this, so you
simply need to run the following command from a terminal (in the root directory of this repository):

`make -j8 libs`

_Note: The `-j8` flag runs make with 8 parallel jobs, feel free to change the number. It works best
if you use the number of cores (including hyperthread cores) on your machine._

Then, build the actual firmware code:

`make -j8`

If successful the compiled binaries will end up in the `build/` directory along with many other
intermediate build files:

```
spotykach.bin
spotykach.elf
```

The `.elf` file is mainly used for debugging. The `.bin` file is the one that the DFU
utilities will flash onto the Seed.

## Flashing the Firmware

The bootloader version used in this project enables USB DFU firmware updating from the _external_
USB port - i.e. the USB-C port on the rear of the main PCB, NOT the one on the Seed. Application
firmware can only be flashed using the USB-C port.

1. Compile the firmware using the steps above
2. Connect the USB-C connector on the main PCB to the computer (ensure the cable is not power-only)
3. Hold the `Reset` button on the back of the unit for ~3 seconds. The leds under bottom pads going to "breathe" in white.
4. Run the command `make program-dfu` from a terminal

Once finished, the device will automatically boot the new firmware.
This can "brick" (temporarily) the device and require reinstallation of either the
bootloader, the firmware binary, or both.
